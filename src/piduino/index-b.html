      <h1 id="intro">Introduction</h1>
      <p>Arduino's and Raspberry Pi's are in many ways complimentary technologies. Both have a large maker community, and are rooted in open source technology.</p>
      <p>The Arduino excels as a dedicated processor, performing a single task. The Arduino's wide variety of low-level analogue and digital input and output has enabled its use in many physical computing projects.</p>
      <p>By contrast, the Raspberry Pi has orders of magnitude more processing power than Arduino's. However, it's multi-tasking nature limits its use in real-time applications, and may be overkill in some simple situations. The Pi has a greater variety of high-level IO capabilities, such as Ethernet and HDMI, enabling it to be used more like an ordinary computer. However, the Pi lacks any analogue input, and has limited analogue output (in the form of a sound card.)</p>
       <p>Using the Pi and Arduino together can provide the best of both devices, extending the range of projects which can be attempted. We will focus on interconnecting the Pi and Arduino over the I&sup2;C (or I2C) bus, a widely supported standard.</p>
      <h1 id="setup">Setting up I&sup2;C</h1>
      <p><a href="img/Complete Setup.JPG"><img src="img/Complete Setup Scaled.JPG" alt="Arduino, Pi connected via breadboard"></a></p>
      <p>The hardware setup is covered in several sub-tutorials:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="../power/index.html">Power Control</a>: It is possible to control from software whether the Arduino's are turned on or off. This can be useful for prototyping, as the Arduino's may be automatically power cycled if an error occurs over the I&sup2;C bus. This is an optional feature, however, and is not required.</li>
        <li><a href="../levels/index.html">Level Shifting</a>: The Pi operates at +3.3 V logic levels, whilst the Arduino operates at +5 V. It is therefore necessary to build a level shifting circuit for I&sup2;C to enable the devices to communicate. Some people have <a href="http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/I2CBi-directionalLevelShifter">reported success</a> without level shifting. However, this involves operating both the Arduino and Pi outside of their specifications, so is not a recommended configuration. In particular, the +5 V output from the Arduino could damage the Pi.</li>
        <li><a href="../i2c/index.html">I2C Tutorial</a>: This explains the basics of the I&sup2;C protocol, and how to configure it on the Pi. <em>Note:</em> if you use a breadboard to produce a breakout of the I&sup2;C bus, as described in the tutorial, then the output of the level shifting circuit should be connected to the rails, not the SDA and SCL pins directly.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A complete circuit (including the power control and level shifting circuit), with an Arduino attached, is pictured for illustration.</p>
      <p>The above tutorials are enough to get I&sup2;C communication entirely up and running. If you feel comfortable programming the Raspberry Pi to be an I&sup2;C master and the Arduino's to be slaves, then you can stop reading! Otherwise, you may find it helpful to adapt the code I have produced below.</p>
      <h1 id="using">Using I&sup2;C</h1>
          <p>Example code for <a href="http://github.com/AdamGleave/ArduinoPiI2C">Arduino and Pi I2C</a> communication is available on GitHub for download as a <a href="http://github.com/AdamGleave/ArduinoPiI2C/archive/master.zip">ZIP file</a>.</p>
          <p>The code for the Raspberry Pi configures it as an I&sup2;C master. It then periodically:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Scans for slaves connected on the bus</li>
            <li>For each slave detected, sends "?" to request a list of variables that can be retrieved</li>
            <li>For each slave, sends the name of each variable to request its value.</li>
            <li>Displays in the console all values received, and logs (in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV</a> format) to a file.</li>  
          </ul>        
         <p>The code for the Arduino configures it as a slave. There is a configuration option to specify the address, which <strong>must be unique</strong>. There are also configuration options to specify the variables to publish.</p>
      <h2 id="rpisoftware">Raspberry Pi</h2>
          <p>First download and extract the software by typing in a terminal:</p>
<pre class=sh>
$ <kbd>wget http://github.com/AdamGleave/ArduinoPiI2C/archive/master.zip</kbd>
$ <kbd>unzip master.zip</kbd>
</pre>
          <p>Note you may see a slightly different output to the example above, depending on what other files you have. The software should be extracted into a directory called "ArduinoPiI2C-Master". You can confirm this by typing:</p>
<pre class=sh>
$ <kbd>ls</kbd>
ArduinoPiI2C-master  Desktop  master.zip  ocr_pi.png  Pi  python_games  test  wiringPi
</pre>
          <p>The code for the Raspberry Pi is stored in the subdirectory ArduinoPiI2C-master/Pi:</p>
<pre class=sh>
$ <kbd>cd ArduinoPiI2C-master/Pi/</kbd>
$ <kbd>ls</kbd>
config.yaml  i2cpoll.py
</pre>
        <p>There are a number of configuration options stored in config.yaml. This file includes comments explaining the meaning of each parameter. The defaults should be suitable for most applications, however it may be necessary to change two parameters:</p>
        <ul>
             <li>enabled in section powerCtl. The default is to enable power cycling when there is an error on the I&sup2;C bus. This should be changed to false if you have not built the power control circuit.</li>
             <li>pin in section powerCtl. The default is <a href="http://pi.gadgetoid.com/pinout/pin26_gpio7">BCM pin 7</a>. You will need to change it if you use a different pin to the one used in the power control tutorial. If you have disabled power control, there is no need to change it.</li> 
            <li>device-id in section i2c. The default is correct for the Raspberry Pi Model B revision 2 and Raspberry Pi Model A, but must be changed to 0 on the Raspberry Pi Model B revision 1.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once you have changed these, and any other options you want, you are ready to run the program. It requires a library called PyYAML to read the configuration file. This can be installed on Raspbian by typing:</p>
<pre class=sh>
$ <kbd>sudo apt-get install python-setuptools</kbd>
$ <kbd>sudo easy_install pip</kbd>
$ <kbd>sudo pip install pyyaml</kbd>
</pre>
        <p>Now run the program by typing:</p>
<pre class=sh>
$ <kbd>cd ArduinoPiI2C-master/Pi/</kbd>
$ <kbd>sudo python i2cpoll.py</kbd>
</pre>
        <p>This will output to the console a few messages briefly describing the startup. On my system, with one Arduino connected, I see:</p>
<pre class=sh>
Opened I2C bus #1
I will list all connected I2C devices and attached sensors, and tell you whenever this changes.

Address 42: Device connected, with sensors: SENSOR1	SENSOR2

Address 42: SENSOR1 = 1934.00000 SENSOR2 = Running for >1 s 
</pre>
        <p>The program will continue to scan for new devices, and poll all detected devices. All values read will be logged to a file called Sensors.csv. For example, the log after letting the program run for around half a minute is:</p>
<pre class=sh>
$ <kbd>cat Sensors.csv</kbd>

</pre>
        <p>To stop the program, type <samp><kbd>Ctrl-C</kbd></samp>.</p>
      <h2 id="arduinosoftware">Arduino</h2>
        <p>Download the code from <a href="http://github.com/AdamGleave/ArduinoPiI2C/archive/master.zip">GitHub</a>. Extract the ZIP file, and open the file <samp>Arduino/Arduino.ino</samp> in the <a href="http://arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> IDE. <img src="img/Arduino Opened.png" alt="Screenshot of Arduino IDE"></p>
        <p>You should paste your code in the first section (displayed above). Rename setup and loop to your_setup and your_loop.</p>
        <p>your_setup should <strong>not</strong> include any code initialising serial output (e.g. a <samp>Serial.begin</samp> call), or any setup related to I&sup2;C. This is handled in the function setup, which is called before your_setup. You can still use serial functions, such as <samp>Serial.println</samp>, as usual.</p>
        <p>For each value you wish to make available via I&sup2;C, your_loop needs to update the value of a global variable: of type <samp>float</samp>, <samp>int</samp>, or <samp>char *</samp> (string).</p>
        <div class="normal alert">
            <h2>Exporting Strings</h2>
            <p>There is a slight subtlety with making a string available over I&sup2;C. If you're only interested in exporting numeric values (<samp>float</samp>'s and <samp>int</samp>'s), this can be safely ignored!</p>
            <p>Responding to requests from the Pi is <em>interrupt driven</em>. <samp>your_loop</samp> can stop executing at any time, with control transferred to the I&sup2;C-handling code <samp>requestEvent()</samp>. This code will send the value of the variable requested, and does not know if <samp>your_loop()</samp> has finished updating the value or not.</p>
            <p>Floating point and integer variables update <em>atomically</em>. That is, assigning a new value to a variable has either completed, or not started. Modifying a character array, however, is not atomic. When an update is interrupted it is possible for, say, only the first half of the character array had been updated.</p>
            <p>The simplest way to avoid this is to always use constant strings, as in the example code. If this is not possible for your application, then an alternative is to use <samp>malloc()</samp> to allocate new memory for your character array. Modify this new character array, <em>without</em> changing the value of the global variable. When the update has finished, modify the value of the global variable to point to the new character array. Then call <samp>free()</samp> on the old character array. (A similar approach is possible using two statically allocated character arrays.)</p>
        </div>
        <p>Once you have finished modifying your code, the only thing left is to modify the configuration. Scroll down to the section marked <samp>CONFIGURATION</samp>. Find the line, <samp>#define I2C_ADDRESS 42</samp>. Change 42 to any address between 8 and 119, <em>not</em> used by any other I&sup2;C device connected.</p>
        <p>Finally, configure your variables by modifying the list <samp>sensor sensors[]</samp>:</p>
        <!-- Bit of an abuse of sh class! But <code></code> isn't defined in style sheet. -->
        <pre class=sh>
sensor sensors[] = {
                      {"SENSOR1", FLOAT, &sensorVal1},
                      {"SENSOR2", STRING, &sensorVal2},
                      //{"SENSOR3", FLOAT, &sensorVal3},
                      //{"SENSOR4", FLOAT, &sensorVal4},
                      //{"SENSOR5", STRING, &sensorVal5},
                    };
        </pre>
        <p>The comments above the list give a detailed explanation of the format. </p>
        <p>Once you have completed the configuration, compile the code and send it to the Arduino. It should be automatically detected by the software running on the Pi, once it is connected.</p>
